= Overview: The Mental Landscape

== 1.1 The Fetch and Execute Cycle : Machine Language

.CPU - Central Processing Unit(중앙처리 장치)
- CPU contains an ARU(Arithmetic Logic Unit) and small number of registers
- also includes special purpose register
- PC(Program Counter)
- CPU uses the PC(Program Counter) to keep tack of where it is in the program it is executing


.RAM(메인 메모리)
- When the CPU executes a program, that program is stored in the computer's main memory(RAM(Random Acess Memory))
- Mainmemory consists of a sequence of locations
- This location is called its address

.program(프로그램)
- a list of instructions
- Each Type of Computer has its own machine language

.Transistors(트랜지스터)
- Each zero or one is called a bit
- each memory location holds a byte(In modern computers) - 8bit
- The memory address of the instruction is the address of the first of those bytes

== 1.2 Asynchronous Events : Polling Loops and Interrupts
- CPU spends almost all of its time fetching instructions from memory and executing them.
- Network intercace that allows the computer to communicate with other computers that are connected to it on a network, either wirelessly or by wire.
- Scanner that converts images into coded binary numbers that can be stored and manipulated on the computer
- Somehow the CPU has to communicate with and control all these devices. - use device driver
- A computer system consiting of many devices is typically organized by connecting those devices to one or more busses

.Polling(폴링)
- CPU to keep checking for incoming data over and over
- This is very Simple, also very inefficient

.Interrupts(인터럽트)
- An interrupt is a signal sent by another device to the CPU

.Asynchronous events(비동기 이벤트)
- In the regular fetch-and-execute cycle, things happen in a predetermined order -> happen synchronized
- But Interrupts make it possible for the CPU to deal efficiently with events that happen 'asynchronously' -> unpredictable times

.multitasking and timesharing(멀티 태스킹과 시분할)
- All modern computers use multitasking to perform several tasks at once
- CPU is so fast, it can quickly switch its attention from one user to another, devoting a fraction of a second to eacch user in turn. - called timesharing.

.Thread(스레드)
- Each of the individual tasks that the CPU is working on is called a thread
- can yield control
- While it is waiting -> blocked
- Most computers cam "forcibly" suspend a thread in this way -> preemptive multitasking

== 1.3 The Java Virtual Machine
- Java, Python, C++ -> high-level programming languages
- high-level -> machine language (from compiler)

.Compiler(컴파일러)
- Which translates the program all at once

.Interpreter(인터프리터)
- Which translates it instruction by instruction, (necessary)

.JVM
- Java has compiler and Interpreter
- JIT Compiler
    * JIT Compiler stored compiled code -> Compiler
    * stored code use -> Interpreter
    * 2 개의 컴파일러
        * Level 1~3 단순 컴파일 - 컴파일러 1
        * Level 4 컴파일, 캐싱 - 컴파일러 2


== 1.4 Fundamental Building Blocks of Programs

.Programing(프로그래밍은 (두 가지 측면을 가짐))
- data and instructions

.Variable(변수)
- memory location
- have types

.Subroutine(서브루틴)
- A subroutine consists of the instructions for performing some task

== 1.5 Objects and Object-orieted Programming
.Object
- Which is a kind of module containing data and subroutines.

== 1.7 The Internet and Beyond
- Computers can be connected together on networks
- Internet has an IP address => converter => domain (use name not number)

.Protocol (프로토콜)
- For communication over the Internet.
- Internet Protocol(IP)
- Transmission Control Protocol(TCP)

.Packets
- All communication over the Internet is in the form of packets.

.SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- to transfer email messages from one computer to another.
