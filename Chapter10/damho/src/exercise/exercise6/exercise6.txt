HOW TO AVOID REINVENTING the wheel? Many data structures and algorithms,
such as those from Chapter 9, have been studied, 
programmed, and re-programmed by generations of computer science students.
This is a valuable learning experience. Unfortunately, they have also been programmed and 
re-programmed by generations of working computer professionals, taking up time that could 
be devoted to new, more creative work. A programmer who needs a list or a binary 
tree shouldn't have to re-code these data structures from scratch. They are well-understood 
and have been programmed thousands of times before. The problem is how to make pre-written, 
robust data structures available to programmers. In this chapter, we'll look at Java's 
attempt to address this problem.
